# scoring-project
Node.js and MySQL

This is a HTML file parser. The program will read a directory and parse each html document within to create a score based
upon HTML tags. These scores will then be added to a MySQL database. The program also has different functions that the user
can then choose to analyze the data that is stored. This includes getting the average scores, getting the scores for a custom data range, getting the scores for a certain file name and more.
